# Advent of Code 2020
A repo to store my code submissions for [AoC 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020). Using JavaScript (NodeJS) for each excercise.

Goals for this event
- Try to figure the answer without Googling it
- Find & implement a _working_ solution step-by-step if can't figure it out
- Completion first, efficiency second

## Getting Started
To run the code, use the command:
```bash
node day_DAY/part_PART.js
```
Where `DAY` and `PART` is the corresponding day & part.

## Roadmap
- [Day 1 ✅]()
- [Day 2 ✅]()
- [Day 3 ✅]()
